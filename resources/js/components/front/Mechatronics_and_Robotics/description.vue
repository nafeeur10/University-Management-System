                        <h3>The Vision of the Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Program</h3>
                        The Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering program at the Faculty of Engineering at the Egyptian Russian University seeks to be in a prestigious position among Mechatronics Engineering programs in Egyptian, Arab and international engineering faculties and to be one of the development elements of the Egyptian-Russian scientific relationships.

                        <h3>The Mission of the Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering Program</h3>
                        The Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering program at the Faculty of Engineering at the Egyptian Russian University supports the integration of educational, research and service process through providing a distinguished curriculum that allows its graduates to compete in different fields of work related to Mechatronics Engineering both locally and regionally, as well as preparing advanced technological engineering researches and unique society services under the umbrella of global quality systems to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development, promote the production of knowledge, and establish the ethical values within a framework of professional responsibility and community partnership.

                        <h3>Aims</h3>
                        On successful completion of the program, the graduates of the Mechatronics and Robotics
                        Engineering program should be able to:
                        Apply and efficiently use knowledge and skills in the field of mechanics, electronics, computers and software systems to solve mechatronics engineering problems.
                        Cooperatively participate in teams for designing, manufacturing and integrating the components of different natures to build, test and operate mechatronic products.
                        Troubleshoot and propose the necessary solutions to solve the problems of different mechatronics systems.
                        Analyze the whole lifecycle of a product and propose the necessary procedures and measures to reach enhanced performance and quality, improved cost-to-benefit ratio and better dependability.
                        Plan and implement a small-scale project either individually or in teamwork especially in the production of new mechatronic product or to develop an old product (This point includes marketing, design, manufacturing, and after purchase services).
                        Communicate effectively with individuals, groups and large-scale enterprises through the efficient use of languages, reporting, and advanced communication means.
                        Recognize of the environmental issues and local and international regulations and supervise depollution programs adopted by the industrial plants.
                        Recognize the contemporary engineering issues and ethical responsibilities. Engage in self- and life-long learning.
                        Participate in the identification and solution of problems facing the society and consider the impacts of engineering solutions on it.
                        Participate in research and development (R&D) programs in mechatronics engineering institutions and industry.
