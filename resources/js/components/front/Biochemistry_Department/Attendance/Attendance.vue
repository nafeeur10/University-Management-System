            You should attend at least 75% of the contact time of each course, about 10 lectures/tutorials in Fall/Spring.
            If your attendance in a course is less than 75%, you will not be allowed to sit for the final exam of that course, and your grade will be WF.
            <br><br>
            A student who is absent of the final exam of a course will have a grade FA 
                    
            <br>
            (Fail Absent).
            However, if absence is for an acceptable reason, the grade will be I (Incomplete), to have a makeup exam during weeks 1,2 of the next semester.
