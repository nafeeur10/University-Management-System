            At the beginning of each semester, you must see the academic advisor and register for the courses to take.
            <br><br>
            You should complete registration during weeks 1,2 of Fall/Spring, and week 1 of Summer, as indicated in the academic calendar.
            <br>        
            <br>
            Each course is assigned a number of credit hours (CH), between 1 and 6, depending on the courseâ€™s learning effort.
            <br>        
            <br>
            Your course load is the total registered CH. Its limits depend on your overall performance (CGPA).
